![Tutorial](./readme/turtorial.png?raw=true "Tutorial")

0. run the .bat.
1. Press "Load" to load the folder that you store your animations files(.hkx). 
2. input the speed you want. (it will multiply the speed of the animations)
3. Press "hkanno64 path" to set the path to your hkanno64.exe.
4. Press "Execute" to run.
5.before entering the game, make sure you launch the nemesis again to updated the animations.

How it speedup:
  Example 1: In your animations folder, there is a .hkx files that has no speed annotation.
  #If you input 1.5. Then the programme will add a annotation with a speed of 1*1.5 = 1.5.

  Example 2: In your animations folder, there is a .hkx files that has a speed annotation which is 1.5.
  #If you input 1.5. Then the programme will the annotation speed to 1.5*1.5=2.25.

Done

Tips1: Numbers smaller than 1 is accepted, which means you can slower the animations by inputing number below 1.
Tips2: This tool will read all files inside the subfolder of the animations folder that you inputed.
Tips3: The config.json is the translation and the setting file for this tool.
       The programme now will automatically generate the string.ini files, incase you miss it.

If you have any suggestions for this tool, please tell me.
